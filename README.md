# compose module

## overview 

- introduction to a design pattern of type structure
- this is a excercise in using types to describe things
- modeling your computation as data types, composing those data types together, rather than composition with functions.
- final take away - if we compose two functors is the result applicative/monad?

## acknowledgments

This learning module is a composition of work by the [CSIRO Data61 functional programming laboratory](https://github.com/data61/fp-course). This module would not be possible without them for permitting us to remix their work.

## excercises

Q: one of these excercises will not be possibile  to achieve. Which one?

Q: if we compose two functors is the result applicative?
